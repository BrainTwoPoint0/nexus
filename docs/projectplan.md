# Project Plan: Enhanced User Profile System

## Problem Analysis

The current user profile system is indeed quite basic and needs significant enhancement to compete with platforms like Nurole. After analyzing the current `/profile/page.tsx`, I've identified major gaps:

### Current State

- ✅ Basic personal information (name, email, phone, location)
- ✅ Simple skills management with add/remove
- ✅ Basic file upload for documents
- ✅ Basic preferences (sectors, locations, roles)
- ✅ Simple privacy settings

### Missing Critical Features

- ❌ Comprehensive board experience management
- ❌ Detailed work history timeline
- ❌ Education and qualifications
- ❌ Compensation expectations
- ❌ Detailed availability preferences
- ❌ Portfolio and achievements showcase
- ❌ Profile completeness indicator
- ❌ Board committee experience
- ❌ Professional references
- ❌ Cultural fit assessment
- ❌ Languages and certifications detail
- ❌ Professional memberships
- ❌ Integration with Supabase database

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Database migration complexity**: Mitigate by testing schema changes in development first
- **Large form performance**: Break into logical sections and implement auto-save

### User Experience Risks

- **Profile completion fatigue**: Make sections optional and show clear progress
- **Information overload**: Use progressive disclosure and clear section organization
- **Mobile usability**: Test thoroughly on various device sizes

### Data Risks

- **Data privacy compliance**: Ensure all personal data handling follows GDPR principles

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Database schema updates and basic structure
- **Day 2**: Profile completeness indicator and enhanced board experience
- **Day 3**: Work history, education, and compensation sections
- **Day 4**: Portfolio, references, and form improvements
- **Day 5**: Testing, polish, and documentation

## Notes
